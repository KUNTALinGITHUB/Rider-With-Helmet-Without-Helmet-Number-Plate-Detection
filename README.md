# üõµ Rider With Helmet / Without Helmet & Number Plate Detection

An AI-powered system that detects whether a rider is wearing a helmet and extracts the vehicle's number plate using YOLO.



---

## üß† Overview

This project employs the **YOLOv5** object detection model to identify:

- **Helmet Detection:** Determines if a rider is wearing a helmet.
- **Number Plate Recognition:** Extracts the vehicle's number plate for identification.

The system is designed for real-time applications, making it suitable for traffic monitoring and enforcement.

## üß© Use Case

- **Traffic Surveillance:** Automatically detects riders without helmets and captures their number plates for enforcement.
- **Security Systems:** Integrates with CCTV systems to monitor and report traffic violations.
- **Law Enforcement:** Assists in identifying and penalizing traffic offenders promptly.
